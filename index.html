                  <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Proxmox VE Intro</h4>
                    <p>Proxmox VE is an open-source virtualization platform that supports hosting multiple virtual machines (VMs) and Linux containers (LXC). It can run a wide range of workloads, including Linux distributions, Windows operating systems, media servers such as Jellyfin, and many others. Proxmox was selected for this file server project due to its flexibility and extensive customization options, which will allow for easy additions in the future.</p>
                  <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Proxmox VE Installation & Configuration</h4>
                    <p>The Proxmox VE 9.0 installation ISO was obtained directly from the official <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/" target="_blank">Proxmox website</a>. After downloading the ISO file, it was then copied to a Ventoy-formatted USB drive. <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html" target="_blank">Ventoy</a> is a useful tool that enables booting multiple ISO images from a single USB device without the need for software such as Rufus.
                      With the Ventoy USB prepared, the system was booted using the Proxmox VE ISO. Once the installer loaded, the graphical installation option was selected to begin the setup process as shown in the example image below.<br> </p>

                      <div class="modal" id="imageModal0" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true">

                            <div class="modal-body p-0">
                              <img src="img/s0.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Proxmox VE Installer">

                        </div>
                      </div>
                    <p>Next, To ensure the Proxmox host always uses the same IP address (static), a DHCP reservation was created on the router. This was done by locating the computer’s MAC address, which runs the Proxmox server in the router’s DHCP client list, and assigning it a reserved IP address. The exact steps may vary depending on the router you have, but the process is generally straightforward. Using a static IP address is important for Proxmox, as it ensures consistent access to the web interface. It also makes it easier to assign additional static IP addresses later, for example, when creating the Ubuntu Server VM. </p>

                    <p>PuTTY was also used to ensure I could successfully remote into the Proxmox environment, as shown here.<br></p>

                    <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Web Interface</h4>
                    <p>With the Proxmox installation complete and the network configured, the web interface can be accessed through a web browser using the static IP address as seen here.<br>

                      </div>
                      Upon logging in, the initial step was to check for any available system updates and apply them. After updating, the Proxmox VE host was rebooted to ensure all changes were fully applied.
                    </p>
                    <p>A Dell OptiPlex 3050 was used for this setup which I made sure to include two storage devices: an SSD which is used to store the Proxmox VE environment and an NVMe drive, totaling to 1TB of capacity. This provides sufficient space for initial testing and deployment, though additional storage will likely be required later as the file server grows and as other services such as a media server are added to the Proxmox environment. Before configuring storage in Proxmox, the secondary drive intended for use with the file server was wiped. After clearing the device, the Proxmox storage directory was accessed to create the new disk resource as shown below.</p>

                  <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Ubuntu Server Intro</h4>
                  <p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server" target="_blank" >Ubuntu Server</a> is a version of the Ubuntu operating system designed specifically for server environments, allowing you to run services such as file servers, web servers, databases and more.<br></p>
                  <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Ubuntu Server Setup & Configuration</h4>
                  <p>To begin configuring the Ubuntu Server, a new virtual machine was created in Proxmox VE using the previously uploaded ISO file. During the installation process, the on-screen setup wizard was followed and adjusted as needed. For this setup, OpenSSH Server was enabled to allow remote access using the Proxmox Command Line Interface (CLI) and others in the future, and a static IP address was assigned instead of using DHCP, consistent with the earlier network configuration steps. <br></p>
                  
                  <p>Now that the Ubuntu Server is up and running, the very first thing to do is check for available updates with the command <b>sudo apt update</b> and <b>sudo apt upgrade</b>. Furthermore, the command <b>sudo apt install unattended-upgrades</b> was used to enable automatic updates, which checks for and installs updates automatically.</p>
                  <p>Next, OpenSSH was installed by running the command <b>sudo apt install openssh-server</b> so the Ubuntu Server could be remotely accessed through the Proxmox root and other terminal emulators using <b>ssh [username]@[ip address]</b></p>
                  <h4 class="text-decoration-underline">Samba File Server</h4>
                  <h5>Step 1: Install Samba</h5>
                  <p>The first step in getting the file server up and running was installing Samba by running the command <b>sudo apt install samba</b>, which will be used to provide file-sharing services/capabilities. Samba was chosen because this was the first file-sharing server being built, and it offered a straightforward setup by following the guide provided on the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-samba#1-overview" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> Webpage.</p>
                  <p><b>One useful thing to note is that when services are installed on Ubuntu Server, their configuration files are typically stored in the /etc directory.</b></p>
                  <h5>Step 2: Configure Samba</h5>
                  <p>A directory was created using <b>mkdir</b>, which represents the name of the file server. Permissions were then configured using <b>sudo chmod -R 0775</b>. In short, chmod stands for “change mode,” and the permission value 0775 grants full read, write, and execute access to the owner and group. The screesnhot below shows permissions that have been set for the file server</p>

                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <p>Next, the Samba configuration file was edited to add a new directory as a shared folder. This was done by running the command <b>sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf</b>. Nano was chosen due to familiarity, though any text editor could be used.</p>
                  <p>Upon opening the Nano text editor, a new profile was added at the bottom of the file and named fileshare, matching the directory name created earlier with mkdir. Below you will find the full profile configuration that was made along with a screenshot of the output.</p>

                  <p>I tried to wipe a disk in Proxmox and was receiving the error “disk/partition ‘/dev/sda2’ is mounted (500)”. After doing some research, I realized that because the Proxmox installation itself is on this disk, it cannot be wiped. The solution was to install an NVMe drive, which the OptiPlex 3050 has a slot for, and this resolved the issue. Below is the message that I was receiving. <a href="https://www.diy-viking.com/proxmox-disk-partition-has-a-holder/" target="_blank" >DIY-Viking</a> was the source of where I was able to find a solution to this issue.</p>
